# OSS Toolkit Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Cohere's OSS toolkit. This guide will help explain the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, to reviewing and merging your added changes. For development setup, please refer to the [README](README.md).

# Getting Started

Remember that there are many ways to contribute other than writing code: writing tutorials or blog posts, improving [the documentation](https://docs.cohere.com), and submitting bug reports.

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Requests (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Cohere's [documentation](https://docs.cohere.com).**
3. **You know about the [Cohere community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/co-mmunity).**

## How to Contribute

1. Ensure your change has an issue! Find an existing issue or open a new issue.
   - This is where you can get a feel if the change will be accepted or not.
2. Once approved, fork this repository repository in your own GitHub account.
3. [Fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
4. Make your changes on your fork and make sure all your [commits are signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)!
5. [Submit the fork as a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch this repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.


## How to add features

All features must be added to the `community` folder. That's where you'll find tools and deployments that are not managed by Codeowners.
